# Interactive Tool for the History and Evolution of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project provides an interactive tool utilizing Google Earth Engine to visually explore the history and evolution of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The tool combines dynamic Earth animations with geographic locations significant to ANN development. Each location is linked to relevant historical content, including PowerPoint presentations detailing milestones and contributions in the field.


## Features:

- **Interactive Earth Animations** : Visualize the geographical progression of ANN advancements through dynamic Earth animations. Explore how different regions have contributed to the development of ANN over time.

- **Geographical Markers** : Highlight key locations where significant milestones in ANN evolution occurred. Each marker on the map represents a notable event or development in the history of ANN.

- **Embedded Content** : Access detailed historical content associated with each location. PowerPoint presentations (PPTs) are attached to each geographic marker, providing in-depth information on the events and breakthroughs in ANN research.

- **Educational Insights** : Gain a comprehensive understanding of ANN's evolution through a blend of visual and textual information. The tool offers an engaging way to learn about the historical development of ANN technology.

- **User Interaction** : Navigate through the map, click on markers, and view related presentations to delve deeper into specific historical events and advancements in ANN.
